    "Alter your program from Lab 8 such that no longer uses a sentinel value; it insteads uses a Y/N response from the user to determine if the user wants to stop entering values. The user enters a Y or N in response to a question if they have additional entries to enter. In your prompts, make sure you tell the user exactly what's expected to be entered. See my output below for an example.\n",
